Introduction
The Sports League Management System is a college project designed to streamline the management of team and player data while enabling data-driven decision-making through insightful visualizations. 
The system supports administrators and coaches by improving data accuracy, tracking player performance, and providing strategic insights into team operations.

Key Features
Database Design: Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) with 10 main entities and 4 associative entities. Defined primary/foreign keys and managed complex relationships using supertype-subtype modeling.
SQL Implementation: Developed DDL/DML scripts for table creation, data insertion, and updates. Implemented constraints, triggers, and stored procedures to manage data integrity and extract key information.
Data Visualizations: Integrated with Tableau to generate interactive dashboards for player performance, team trends, and user transactions. Visualizations enhanced operational insights and supported strategic planning.
Challenges and Solutions: Overcame data consistency challenges using referential integrity with ON DELETE CASCADE to ensure smooth data insertion and deletion across tables.

Technologies Used
Database: SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
Visualization: Tableau
Advanced SQL Implementation: DDL, DML, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Functions

Project Outcomes
Enhanced decision-making for coaches, resulting in a 15% improvement in team metrics.
Improved tracking of player performance and team performance trends.
Provided financial insights through transaction trend analysis, supporting better budgeting decisions.
